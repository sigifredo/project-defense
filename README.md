# Project Defense Countdown

A simple and intuitive countdown webpage I created to help **me** track the time remaining until my thesis project defense. It keeps me focused and motivated as I prepare for this important milestone. If you find it useful for your own project defense or any other deadline, feel free to use it too! ðŸš€
